I had the idea that if you use JS cookies and HTML5 localStorage together that it might be 
possible to create a loop where after permission had been granted to store data a site owner 
could recreate a cookie from localStorage and vice versa. This is just a proof of concept and 
might be considered somewhat 'Black Hat'.
